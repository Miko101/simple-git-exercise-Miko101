I like to eat: depends on my mood... but mostly raw food - or junk food - or french cuisine
I like to hear: jazz, liturgic, jam
My hobbies are reading, diving, learning, spending time with my wife and kids, beekeeping.

I would like to travel to somewhere over the rainbow.

Only dead fishes flow along the river, living ones choose their own course.

(...Continued from [Step 1](..))

##Step 2
1. Find a decent and copyright free [ASCII art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art) online, or draw one.
2. Create a new file in the folder.  The file name should include only lower case letters, numbers and underscore and be descriptive.  The extensions should be `txt`.
3. `git add` it, `git commit` your work, and `git push` it.
